	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity analysis allows developers to determine how efficient an algorithm 
        is by estimating the computational time required for execution.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the total amount of working memory an algorithm 
        needs to run, which is often expressed using Big O notation like O(n).
